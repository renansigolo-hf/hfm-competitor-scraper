# HFM Competitor Scraper

A simple script to scrape data from our competitor's website.

## Pre-requisetes

- Make sure you have [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/) or higher installed.

## Usage

- In order to run the script, you need to install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Run the script by running `npm start "value 1, value 2, value 3"`. Make sure to replace the values in the quotes with the values you want to scrape in a comma-separated values (CSV) format.
- If all goes well, you should see a new file in the current directory called `coles-data-DD-MM-YYYY.csv` with all the data.
